17,Albizia lebbeck,Acacia speciosa,"Hiraru, Moroi, Mog, Kako, Sundi, Saw, Harish","Siris tree is a very fast-growing deciduous tree with an open, large, spreading crown; it usually reaches a height of 15 - 20 metres, with exceptional specimens growing up to 30 metres. The straight, cylindrical bole can be 50 - 100cm in diameter, with exceptional specimens to 300cm. In India plantation-grown siris yields a high quality hardwood that is traded in Europe as 'Indian walnut' or 'koko'. The tree has been widely planted in agro-forestry schemes in the drier parts of the Tropics. Plants are used to provide shade for coffee and cocoa plantations as well as to provide a valuable timber and fuel. It is a popular amenity tree throughout the dry tropics because of its shady spreading habit, although the copious litter produced beneath it is often regarded as a disadvantage","The wood dust is aromatic and peppery. It may cause irritation to the nose and throat of sawmill workers. The bark is used as a fish poison. A red dye obtained from the bark has caused skin irritation. The pods contain saponin and are not eaten in large amounts by sheep, although cattle eat them readily.",E. Asia - drier areas of the Indian subcontinent and southeastern Asia to northern Australia.,Tropical to subtropical sandy river beds and savannahs.,"Habit Deciduous Tree Height 15.00 m Growth Rate Fast Pollinators Bees, Insects Cultivation Status Cultivated, Ornamental, Wild","Although siris will grow in the humid tropics, its natural range is in semi-arid to sub-humid areas of the tropics and subtropics that have marked dry and reliable wet seasons. However, it may be established under conditions of low (400 mm/year) and irregular rainfall. Plants can succeed at elevations from sea level to 1,800 metres in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 26 - 36°c, but can tolerate 12 - 48°c. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 600 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 500 - 2,500mm. Seedlings will not tolerate frost, but trees are moderately frost resistant when established. Prefers a well-drained, moisture-retentive soil and a position in full sun. Plants are able to succeed in most soil types, including saline but excluding cracking clay, so long as they are well drained. Tolerant of degraded or nutritionally poor soils. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 7, tolerating 5.5 - 8.5. Established plants are very drought tolerant. Seedlings will not tolerate waterlogging. Requires a position sheltered from strong winds. Widely cultivated, the tree has become established in the wild in various areas outside its native range and is considered to be invasive in some of these areas. A fast-growing species, it can reach a height of 18 metres within 10 years from seed. When grown as a fuel crop on a coppice rotation of 10 - 15 years, it can produce about 5 cubic metres per hectare. Optimum annual wood production is 15 - 20 cubic metres per hectare. Plants have brittle limbs that can break off in high winds. They also have a shallow, though wide-spreading root system that does not support them well in windy positions. The dried seedpods hanging on the tree constantly rattle in the wind. Reserves in the root system enable young plants to survive total defoliation from fire or grazing, but with an obvious setback in growth. The tree coppices well, responds to pollarding, pruning and lopping, and will produce root suckers if the roots are exposed The trees are killed by even light fires. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby. The tree is not Rhizobium specific, and native strains are nearly always capable of producing an abundance of nodules.",None known,"The leaves and seeds are used in the treatment of eye problems such as ophthalmia.  The bark is astringent It is taken internally to treat diarrhoea, dysentery and piles. The bark is used externally to treat boils.  The flowers are applied locally to maturate boils and alleviate skin eruptions.  The powdered seeds are used to treat scrofula.  Saponin from the pods and roots has spermicidal activity","Agroforestry Uses: A fast-growing tree that fixes atmospheric nitrogen and succeeds in full sun, it is an excellent plant to use as a pioneer when establishing woodland or woodland gardens, though its ability to invade areas outside its native range means that it is best used only within its native area. Due to its extensive, fairly shallow root system, the tree is a good soil binder and is recommended for eroded lands and erosion control, for example along river embankments. The nitrogen-rich leaves are valuable as mulch and green manure. Light transmission through the canopy of free-standing trees is 40 - 50%. Free-standing trees appear to enhance pasture production and quality beneath the canopy due to the increased nitrogen status of the soil. In an open woodland environment it has been repeatedly observed that there is modification of the ground cover with enhancement of grass production and quality beneath the canopy. Seedlings and cuttings are used as an initial shade in coffee, cardamom, cocoa plantations etc. The tree is also used in rehabilitating old cocoa farms or on improved fallows intended for cocoa cultivation due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Although not completely wind firm, the tree is tolerant of salt-laden winds and can be planted in moderately exposed coastal situations and as quick-growing shelter for less hardy plants. A valued honey tree because of its production of both nectar and pollen. Other Uses It seems probable that the fruits can yield 10 barrels of ethanol per hectare per year.  The trunk yields a reddish gum that is used as an adulterant of gum arabic. A red dye is obtained from the bark. It can cause skin irritation.  The bark contains 7 - 11% tannin and is used locally in India for tanning fishing nets.  When dried and pounded, the bark can be used for soap.  The heartwood is golden brown when freshly cut, turning to a rich dark brown with black streaks; it is clearly demarcated from the paler sapwood. The texture is medium to coarse; the grain deeply interlocked; lustre is medium; there is no distinctive odour or taste The wood is moderately heavy and hard; strong and fairly durable. It seasons well, works and polishes easily. An excellent, very decorative timber, it has been compared to black walnut. The wood is suitable for turnery, carving, general construction, furniture, veneer, agricultural implements etc. More generally the wood is useful for fuel wood because of its high productivity. It makes an excellent charcoal","Seed. The species is not particularly hard-seeded and requires only mild treatment (e.g. in water at 50 °c for 3 minutes) to germinate successfully. Be careful, though, since some seeds are quite thin-skinned and can be damaged if the water is too hot. A proportion of the seeds germinate immediately without any treatment. Plants can be direct-sown, container grown, or raised in a massed seed-bed and planted out as bare-rooted stems. There is nothing published on preferred rhizobial strains but it appears to nodulate readily without inoculation. Cuttings. Air layering."

It prefers a mean annual rainfall between 650 - 3,000 mm and normally experiences a 4 - 5 month dry season. Seedlings and young trees are susceptible to frost. Grows best in fertile soils. Requires a well-drained soil and a position in full sun or light shade. Young trees require some shade. Established trees are drought resistant. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 4.5 - 7.5. The tree grows sporadically in both dry and moist deciduous forest zones. Under tropical conditions the species is not gregarious. It tolerates hot humid conditions but not waterlogging. On good sites 5-year-old trees can be 5 metres in height and the trunk 14 cm in diameter. A mean annual diameter increment of 1.3 cm has been recorded for this species. Trees coppice well, new shoots reaching a height of 3 metres in 2 years after being cut down. Plants are susceptible to fire, resistant to weed competition and drought. They regenerate naturally in sheltered areas with good soil. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby.","The bark is used in the manufacture of a fermented sugar cane wine, known as 'basi', and consumed in the Philippines.","None known Agroforestry Uses: Black siris is an excellent companion tree. It fixes atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with bacteria on the root. The tree utilizes the subsoil moisture and nutrients not available to plants and protects them from hail and rainstorms. It is used in reforestation programmes and is also planted for soil conservation. It produces a well-developed root system that decreases erosion. It is planted as a pioneer species in northern Thailand in reforestation projects to restore native woodland - it is planted in degraded woodland and open areas in a mix with various other species that all have the ability to grow fast; produce dense, weed-suppressing crowns; and attract seed-dispersing wildlife, particularly birds and bats. The tree has contributed 16 kgs/ha of nitrogen from 655 kgs of dry weight leaf litter in trials and provides organic matter and soil nutrients to the rhizosphere of understory plants. Tree canopies decrease soil desiccation and suppress weed growth. Its presence in tea monoculture reduces the incidence of tea pests, particularly red spider mites and scarlet mites.","The tree produces an insoluble gum which is mixed with other gums and used as an extender.  A brown dye is obtained from the wood.  The heartwood of mature trees is a beautiful dark brown colour. The wood is hard, close-grained, 20 - 40% stronger than teak. A premium quality wood, it is suitable for panelling and furniture. It is also used for carts, wheels, farm implements and construction timbers. A valuable fuel wood, dead and defective branches from shade trees are a major source of fuel.","Seed - to break dormancy the seed can be soaked in cool water for 1 hour, in 80 deg C water for two minutes, or in boiling water for 30 seconds. Removed from the water, moist seed is stored overnight and then sown the following morning. Seedlings emerge within a week. Fresh seed may have a germination rate of 99%. Germination of year-old seed decreases to 55-65%. Sow 2 - 3 seeds in each container at a depth of 5 - 20 mm and cover with a thin layer of sand"

35,Aquilaria malaccensis,Agallochum malaccense,"Agar, Diang Agar & Bolagar","Agar wood is an evergreen tree growing up to 49 metres tall, though it is usually rather smaller at around 20 metres. The bole can be up to 60cm in diameter. The aromatic resin obtained from this tree is one of the most famous and most expensive on the planet. It has a very long history of use in religious ceremonies, at funerals etc in the Orient and is widely sought after as an ingredient in perfumery. Commonly harvested from the wild, trials are being carried out into growing it in plantations. The tree has been heavily overexploited in the wild leading to strong concerns that it could become extinct. It is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List (2009) and is considered critically endangered in India",None known,"E. Asia - northeast India through Myanmar, Malaysia to Indonesia and the Philippines","An upper canopy tree, commonly found scattered in dense primary forest and the more open, secondary formations, mainly in plains but also on hillsides and ridges up to 750 metres. Mostly by rivers and streams and on ridges with sandy soils653","Habit Evergreen Tree Height 20.00 m Cultivation Status Cultivated, Wild","Grows best in undulating terrain in the moister lowland tropics, being found at elevations of 200 - 700 metres. It prefers an annual rainfall of 1,500 - 6,500 mm, a mean annual maximum temperature of 22 - 28°c and a mean annual minimum temperature of 14 - 21°c. Prefers heavy soils developed from gneiss and other metamorphic rocks, but it also grows well on sandy loams developed from sandstone. The extremely high prices paid for high quality agar wood and for the essential oil and the indiscriminate felling of both diseased and healthy trees threaten natural stands of Aquilaria including Aquilaria malaccensis to extinction. Research into possibilities of artificial induction and stimulation of agar wood formation is therefore urgently required and may offer high economic returns, especially as trials indicate that management of plantations presents no great difficulties. Unless such methods are developed, Aquilaria malaccensis may soon be extinct. Plantations have been established, mainly for experimental purposes, to test methods for the induction of agar wood formation. Three closely related species of Aquilaria are considered to be the major sources of agar wood and are distinguished by the length of their calyx lobes:- Aquilaria crassna, which comes from Indo-China, has lobes 12 - 15mm long. Aquilaria malaccensis, from India, and Malaysia has lobes 2 - 3mm long. Aquilaria sinensis, from China, has lobes 8mm long. A number of other species are less important sources of agar wood, including some minor Aquilaria spp., Enkleia malaccensis and the timbers Gonystylus bancanus and G. macrophyllus. Trees are generally quite slow growing. They have been recorded as reaching a height of nearly 5 metres and a diameter of 30 cm 8 years after planting, whilst 67 year old plantation trees in Malaysia had reached an average height of 27 metres and a diameter of 38 cm. Mature trees aged around 80 years may reach a height of 25 - 30 metres and a diameter at breast height of 55 - 70 cm.  Flowering and fruiting may start at an age of 7 - 9 years. Good seed years occur infrequently and a medium sized tree may then produce 1.5 kg seed. The best agarwood yields are from trees of 50 years age or more but resin is produced as early as 20 years. Agar wood formation is a pathological process taking place in the stem or main branches where an injury has occurred. Fungi are involved in the process, but the process itself is not yet fully understood. Damage by boring insects is often associated with the infection. It is believed that the tree is first attacked by a pathogenic fungus, which causes it to weaken. Infection by a second fungus causes the formation of agar wood, but it is unclear whether it is a product of the fungus or the tree. The fungus implicated in the formation of agar wood in this species is Cytosphaera mangiferae, while Melanotus flavolives is assumed to play a similar role in Aquilaria sinensis. This species forms an association with endotrophic mycorrhizal fungi.",The resin is used to flavour curries in Malaysia,"Agar wood is an astringent, stimulant, tonic herb that relieves spasms, especially of the digestive and respiratory systems, and lowers fevers.  In Western, Chinese and Indian medicines the incense is used against cancer, especially of the thyroid gland. In China it is applied as a sedative against abdominal complaints, asthma, colic and diarrhoea, and as an aphrodisiac and carminative.  The grated wood enters into various preparations used especially during and after childbirth, and to treat rheumatism, smallpox and abdominal pains. Decoctions of the wood are said to have anti-microbial properties, e.g. Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Shigella flexneri","Agar wood is the rare and famous, resin-containing heartwood that is produced mainly from old and diseased trees of several members of this genus. In trade a distinction between the wood from these species is rarely made. The fragrance produced by the burning agar wood has been highly valued for thousands of years, and its use as incense for ceremonial purposes in Buddhism, Confucianism and Hinduism is widespread throughout eastern and southern Asia. In Thailand it is put into funeral pyres, while in Japan, the incense is used in tea ceremonies. Wood only partly saturated with resin but still fragrant, and occasionally also the wood remaining after distillation, is made into sticks called 'joss-sticks' or 'agarbattis' which are burnt as incense. The incense is also used as an insect repellent.  Agar-wood oil is an essential oil obtained by water and steam distillation of agar wood. It is used in luxury perfumery for application in e.g. Oriental and woody-aldehydic bases, ‘chypres’ and ‘fougères’. It produces interesting odour notes with clove oil, e.g. In carnation bases. The oil is so rare and expensive that it is only produced on request. Agar-wood oil is a yellow to dark amber, viscous liquid with a characteristic balsamic and woody odour. Its aroma has some resemblance with vetiverol or styrax and has a sweetness similar to that of sandalwood oil. Its odour is long-lasting and exhibits a good tenacity in applications.  The silvery inner bark can be removed from the trunk in a single large sheet. It is highly valued for its strength and durability and is made into cloth and ropes. It is also made into writing material which was formerly only used for chronicles of important events and religious books.  The timber of undiseased trees, known as ‘karas’, is soft and very light with a density of about 400 kg/m3 air dry. It is creamy white to pale yellowish-brown or greyish-brown, heartwood and sapwood not clearly differentiated. The texture is rather coarse and the wood diffuse-porous. It is suitable for making boxes, light indoor construction and veneer. The scented wood differs from the normal wood due mainly to deposition of an aromatic resin. The resin is concentrated in the included phloem strands. Because of the resin content the scented wood is relatively hard, brittle and heavy.","Seed should be sown immediately, as it remains viable for only about 1 month. It is sown in nursery beds, about 5 mm deep in a mixture of soil, sand and manure and kept under light shade. Germination starts after 10 - 12 days and is normally complete after 1 month. Seed sown immediately after collection has about 65% germination, falling to 45% after 1 week and only 5% after 3 weeks in storage. The seedlings are very prone to insect attack. Seedlings are pricked out into containers 40 - 45 days after germination when they are 3 - 5 cm tall, and are kept under shade. They are ready for transplanting when 30 - 35 cm tall and 10 - 12 months old. Transplanting bare-rooted seedlings has been tried successfully in some areas. Fruit harvested for seed should be collected when mature but still green. A medium- sized tree produces about 2,000 seeds per year, but seed production may fluctuate greatly between years. The fruits are dried in the shade for about 2 days, they then burst and release the seed."

The bole, which is usually up to 80cm in diameter but can reach 200cm, is usually unbuttressed, but can sometimes have small buttresses. A very important multipurpose tree with a wide range of uses, it is particularly valued for its fruit. The tree is widely cultivated in tropical regions, especially southeast Asia and Brazil, for its edible fruit and seed. There are many named varieties301",None known,E.

Prefers a climate without a dry season, but can tolerate a short dry season. Jackfruits can grow at higher elevations than the breadfruit and also in cooler and drier climates. They can even succeed in warm temperate areas, but they remain small and any fruit is of poor quality. Trees can bear fruit at latitudes up to 30° from the equator, with good crops up to 25° distant. Succeeds in a variety of soils. Prefers a deep, well-drained alluvial soil. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7.5, tolerating 4.3 - 8. Young plants need some shade, but need increasing light levels as they mature. Mature plants are relatively drought resistant. Plants have poor drought tolerance. There are two main groups of cultivars, one group has soft rinds whilst the other has hard. Jackfruits produce one of the largest fruits in the world. The trees have a deep taproot. Plants can produce their first crop within 3 years of the seed germinating, but 8 years is a more common time. Flower and fruit loads are initially low and improve with increasing size and age; trees 2 years old produce about 25 flowers and 3 fruits; trees 5 years old bear as many as 840 flowers, and trees 6 years old 1,500 flowers. However, only 15-18 fruits develop due to the low production of female spikes (about 0.6-5% of the total number of inflorescences. Young trees bear more male than female flowers at a ratio of 4:1; production of female flower increases with age. A male-to-female ratio of 2:1 produces 250 fruits per tree, and as the trees ages, fruit productivity declines. In suitable environments trees bear fruits and flowers throughout the year, but in areas with distinct dry and wet seasons, flowering occurs in the wet season. In young trees, fruits are usually borne on branches and in older trees, on trunks and roots. Jackfruit exhibits fairly rapid growth, attaining a height of 3 metres and a canopy diameter of 2 metres at 2 years of age. In 5 years, the tree height reaches 7 metres and the canopy diameter 4 metres; trees 20 years old are about 18 metres, as tree growth slows down with age.","Fruit - raw or cooked in a variety of ways. The pulp of young fruit is rich in carbohydrates and is usually cooked as a vegetable. The fruit becomes sweeter as it ripens, as some of the carbohydrates are converted into sugars. It is often eaten raw at this stage, but is also still cooked as a vegetable. The rind of the fruit yields a fair jelly. The fruit case is enormous, it can be 30 - 50cm long, weigh up to 20kg and contain up to 500 individual golden-coloured fruits. They have rather a strong smell which some people do not like, though they can be dried when the smell is less. A sticky white latex can impede separating the edible part of the fruit - inexperienced eaters can get it stuck all over their hands, but it can be removed by using cooking oil.  Seed - cooked. Lovely when boiled or roasted, with a flavour and texture similar to chestnuts. They can be ground into a powder and used in making biscuits. The seeds have a high starch content and about 5% protein. When boiling the seeds, the water is sometimes changed 2 or three times in order to remove an objectionable odour.  Very young fruits and leaf shoots - cooked in soups and stews.  Young male flowers are eaten mixed with chillies, sugar, salt etc.","The ashes of leaves, with or without oil, are used to treat ulcers, diarrhoea, boils, stomach-ache and wounds.  The pulp and seeds of the fruit are regarded as a cooling tonic. The seeds are said to be an aphrodisiac.  The sap is an anti-syphilitic and a vermifuge.  The wood is claimed to have sedative properties, and its pith is said to be able to induce abortion.  A root decoction is used to alleviate fever, treat diarrhoea, skin diseases and asthma.  The bacteriolytic activity of the latex is equal to that of papaya latex. Dried latex yields artotenone, a compound with marked androgenic action; it can also be mixed with vinegar to promote healing of abscesses, snakebite and glandular swellings.","The tree has a wide-ranging root system and can be planted to control floods and soil erosion in farms. It is suitable for use in reforestation projects. The tree is often used in mixed plantings. It can be used as a shade tree for coffee, planted with coconut groves, has been used as an intercrop in durian orchards, and with mango and citrus. Young jackfruit orchards may be intercropped with annual cash crops such as banana, sweet corn and groundnut. Other Uses The inner part of the bark or bast is occasionally made into cordage or cloth.  The latex obtained from the trunk and branches yields 71.8% resin, consisting of 63.3% fluavilles (yellow) and 8.5% albanes (white). These resins may be valuable in varnishes. The latex is commonly used as adhesive for mending broken chinaware or earthenware, caulking boats, mending holes of buckets and trapping birds. In India and Brazil, the latex serves as a substitute for rubber.  The bark yields a dark, water-soluble resinous gum that contains 3.3% tannin. When boiled with alum, the sawdust or chips of the heartwood produce a rich yellow dye used for silk and the cotton robes of Buddhist priests.  Wood is yellow at first, becoming red. It is classified as medium hardwood. It is resistant to termite attack and fungal and bacterial decay and is easy to season. It takes polish beautifully. Though not as strong as teak, it is considered superior to that wood for furniture, construction, turnery and inlay work, masts, oars, implements and musical instruments. The wood is widely used in India and Sri Lanka and is even exported to Europe. The roots of old trees are highly prized for carvings and picture framing. The wood is used for fuel.","Seed - under suitable conditions, germination begins within 10 days, and 80-100% germination is achieved within 35-40 days after sowing. The seed quickly loses viability and so should be sown as soon as possible. Seedlings produce a long taproot and can be difficult to transplant, so it is best to pot them up into deep pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and to plant them out into their permanent positions as soon as possible. The seed germinates best at a temperature of 24 - 27c. Root cuttings. Air layering."

The hydrodistilled essential oils, when screened for their anti-fungal activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Microsporum microsporum audounil ( which cause ring worm diseases in animals and humans), exhibited fungicidal or fungistatic toxicity and were more effective than the synthetic antifungal agents, clotrimazole, griseofulvin or nystatin.","The leaves yield around 2% essential oil with a specific gravity of 1.025. It is soluble in 1.2 volume of 70% alcohol. The oil resembles cinnamon leaf oil and contains phellandrene and 78% eugenol. The essential oil from the bark, known as 'cassia oil', is pale yellow, and contains 70 - 85% cinnamic aldehyde. The oil is used in perfuming soap and in medicine. However, trade in cassia oil has declined appreciably with the advent of synthetic cinnamic aldehyde.  The leaf extracts are used as clarifiers in dyeing procedures with myrobalans or kamala.","Seed - the seed has a short viability and is best sown as soon as it is ripe. Remove the fruit pulp since this can inhibit germination. Germination can take 1 - 6 months at 20°c. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in containers. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions when 10cm or more tall.

The powdered bark is applied to the skin in cases of broken bones before a plaster is applied, to improve healing. Bark powder is used externally in the treatment of skin diseases.   A macerate of the leaves is used as a treatment for sleeping-sickness taken internally, and applied externally as a lotion to the fly-bites. The juice of the leaves is applied to the forehead to relieve headaches. The leaves are applied to wounds, sores and ulcers.   The sticky, mucilaginous pulp of the fruit is the source of a well-known medicine in the Near and Middle East. Called 'sapistan', it is useful in the treatment of coughs, sore throats and chest-complaints on account of its demulcent property. The fruit is also used externally as an emollient plaster to maturate abscesses, to calm rheumatic pain and as an antiparasitic on ringworm.   Stereols and a gum have been recorded in the leaves. The leaves and the fruits contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, saponins, terpenes and sterols.

The trees produce three types of flower; male, a long-styled female and a short-styled female flower, often called the gall flower. All three types of flower are contained within the structure we usually think of as the fruit. The female fig wasp enters a fig and lays its eggs on the short styled female flowers while pollinating the long styled female flowers. Wingless male fig wasps emerge first, inseminate the emerging females and then bore exit tunnels out of the fig for the winged females. Females emerge, collect pollen from the male flowers and fly off in search of figs whose female flowers are receptive. In order to support a population of its pollinator, individuals of a Ficus spp. must flower asynchronously. A population must exceed a critical minimum size to ensure that at any time of the year at least some plants have overlap of emmission and reception of fig wasps.

It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22 - 34°c, but can tolerate 16 - 46°c. It can be killed by temperatures of 1°c or lower. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 2,500mm, but tolerates 750 - 5,000mm. Requires a sunny position, even when young. Grows on many soils from acidic laterites to calcareous loams, but doing poorly on thin or poor soils with hardpan, dry sands, or heavily leached acidic soils, well-drained basic alluviums. It does not thrive where the drainage is poor, while on dry, sandy or otherwise poor soil it remains stunted and is apt to assume little more than a shrubby form because of repeated dying back through drought. Established plants are drought tolerant. Prefers a pH in the range 6 to 8. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6, tolerating 4 - 7.5. A very fast growing tree, it can reach 3 metres in height within its first year from seed and 20 metres within 4 - 5 years. The first flowers are borne 3 - 4 years after planting. Annual fuel wood production potential is 18 - 35 cubic metres per hectare. The tree has a lifespan of about 40 years. Trees coppice well with vigorous shoot growth. Plants can resprout after forest fires. Seed years recorded from various locations show that the tree seeds well every year. There are 2 peak periods for floral bud burst, which may vary from year to year, and with the local climatic conditions. In nature, self-pollination is discouraged by the floral morphology. However, in controlled self-pollination, flowers develop into fruits. Mature fruits are produced 1 week after the flowering peak and fruiting may be spread over a 2 month period. Although able to compete with weeds more successfully than many other species, it responds positively to weeding and also benefits from irrigation. Flowers produce abundant nectar, which produces high-quality honey.","The fruit is edible. A bitter-sweet taste. Thedark purple to yellow fruit is an obovoid drupe, 18 - 25mm long with an aromatic, succulent flesh.  The flowers are mixed with rice to make a delicious cake-like festive dish that is eaten on the traditional New Year","The bark, leaves and roots contain traces of alkaloids and are used medicinally in the plants native range. For example, both fruit and bark have medicinal properties against bilious fever.  The roots have great medicinal value as a blood purifier, laxative, stomachic, tonic and as an antidote to poisons.  The leaf sap is used as a demulcent to treat gonorrhoea and cough, and is also applied to wounds and ulcers.  The flowers have been used to treat leprosy and blood diseases.","Agroforestry Uses: A highly light-demanding species, it is a pioneer plant that regenerates naturally only in the open and on the edge of forests. It is an ideal choice for large-scale reforestation programmes. It is planted as a pioneer species in northern Thailand in reforestation projects to restore native woodland - it is planted in degraded woodland and open areas in a mix with various other species that all have the ability to grow fast; produce dense, weed-suppressing crowns; and attract seed-dispersing wildlife, particularly birds and bats. It is intercropped with crops like maize and cassava, which has been found beneficial in increasing the simultaneous production of wood and food. When intercropped with maize and cassava, it performs better under closely stocked stands of cassava, yams and maize. Cassava, however, suppresses re-growth of stumped trees and should, therefore, be planted 3 months later. Gmelina forms an integral component of a taungya system where it is intercropped with peanut, cashew nut, tobacco, maize and beans. Some limitations are that it casts heavy shade, and nothing will grow under a dense 2 x 2 metres stand; it forms a leaf carpet beneath trees, creating a mild fire hazard in times of prolonged drought. It is used in enrichment planting on cocoa farms where its fast growing nature will quickly fill in gaps in the canopy. Cuttings and seedlings can be planted as shade for young and old cocoa trees providing protection whilst also suppressing invasive grasses. The tree is often grown as a windbreak and as a hedge. Other Uses Both the wood ash and the fruit yield a very persistent yellow dye.  Although they do not contain saponins, the bruised leaves give a strong, frothing liquid.  When first cut, the heartwood is yellowish to reddish-white, turning light russet or yellowish-brown; it is indistinctly demarcated from the 5 - 7cm wide band of whitish sapwood. The grain is straight to interlocked; the texture medium to coarse; the wood somewhat oily to the touch; there are knots of variable sizes. The wood is light in weight; soft to hard; very strong, susceptible to fungi, dry wood borers and termites but said to be durable under water. The natural durability of the wood is about 15 years. It seasons well without degrading, but it is slow to dry both in the open and in a kiln; once dry it is moderately stable to stable in service. It saws easily and has only slight blunting effects on tools; it planes to a smooth finish; polishes well; when knots are present the cutting angles should be reduced; it is too soft for satisfactory turning; nailing is fairly easy, but pre-boring is recommended for screwing as the wood tends to split. Rotary peeling and slicing are easy even without pretreatment, and the veneers are easy to handle without a tendency to tear; they remain flat during drying. The gluing properties are reported as good. Where it is indigenous, the wood is regarded as a valuable general-purpose wood because of its dimensional stability. Uses include the manufacture of furniture, plywood core stock, mine props, matches and timber for light construction. It is also used for making canoes, musical instruments, for carving images etc. The wood produces good-quality pulp. Unmixed semi-chemical pulp is suitable only for carton board or low-grade writing paper, but kraft pulp of yemane wood is suitable for higher grades of writing paper. It is also utilized for particle board. The wood burns well and makes a good fuel and charcoal. Is planted mostly for firewood, which has a calorific value of 4800 kcal/kg. For firewood, a spacing of 2 x 2 metres is recommended. Plantations have been established for tobacco curing.","Seed - pre-treatment is not necessary, though for quick germination, the seeds should be soaked for 48 hours in warm water. The seeds germinate within 20 - 50 days under ideal conditions; the average rate for a healthy seed lot is 60%. Trees can be raised easily by transplanting, which is carried out in the rainy season, or by direct sowing in lines; the latter has proved to be more successful in some instances. Viable seeds should be collected from standing trees of superior phenotype. Normally, seed is collected from the ground, depulped and the stones are dried. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability can be maintained for several years in hermetic storage at 3°c with 7-10% mc. Large cuttings planted during the rainy season do well."

The wood is valued for making small items such as combs and for turnery, it is also used for construction, window frames, furniture, bobbins, boxes, piano keys, rulers etc. The wood is reported to be acid-resistant, making it suitable for use as laboratory bench tops etc.","Seed - it is very small and so should only just be covered with soil. The seed is best sown in a seed-box that is placed in light shade and protected from heavy rain. Water frequently but carefully with a very fine spray. Germination ordinarily takes place in about 20 - 40 days. As soon as the seedlings are large enough to handle, that is, in about two to three months, they should be pricked out about 5cm apart in boxes ; the more vigorous ones may even be pricked out about 10cm apart in nursery-beds. The seedlings will be ready to plant out in the forest early the following rains. Transplanting is not unattended with risk owing to the liability of the seedlings to die of drought ; care is therefore necessary to keep a ball of earth round the roots. Risk is further avoided by pricking out the plants into baskets or bamboo tubes instead of into boxes or nursery-beds, so that there is no interference with the roots during transplanting. Young seedlings grow very slowly in their first year, reaching a height of only 25 - 150mm. And are very susceptible to being washed away or beaten down with rain at this time. Growth is faster in the second year, with plants reaching heights of 30 - 60cm or more. Plants develop a thin but long tap root in their first year, this thickens and develops considerably in the second year. The seed can be stored for at least 12 months."

The tree yields a pulp of satisfactory brightness and performance as a handsheet. The wood can be easily impregnated with synthetic resins to increase its density and compressive strength.","Seed - best sown in a nursery - direct sowing is not very successful because of the small-sized seeds and the their sensitivity to drought, excessive moisture and direct sun. The epigeous germination begins in about 10 - 14 days in the rainy season. When the seedlings are 8 - 12 weeks old, they are transplanted to nursery beds or plastic bags. It is recommended to use a medium that is enriched with organic matter. After 6 - 7 months, when the seedlings are about 30cm tall, they are ready for transplanting into the field. They can be planted bare-rooted with little loss in survival rate. The young seedlings are highly susceptible to weeds and should be weeded regularly. 2-month seedlings can be transplanted in nursery beds or into polythene bags, where they can be retained before planting at the start of the monsoon rains. To ensure successful establishment, seedlings should be planted out with their balls of earth. Successful extraction of seed from ripe fruits involves air drying, crushing, and sieving through a No. 35 US Standard sieve to separate seed from chaff. The fruits are first soaked in the open until rotted, then ground by hand into a thick slurry, air dried, and passed through a series of sieves terminating with a No. 35.

Applied externally, it is a very beneficial treatment for a variety of skin complaints, wounds, sores, burns, boils etc and is used in the form of liniment plasters, poultices, herbal steam baths and inhalers. Agroforestry Uses: A pioneer species, its natural range is extended by colonization following disturbances such as fire. It grows, for instance, scattered in fire-prone grassland and woodland. The trees are increasing in number in recently disturbed areas. This species is the preferred species for reforestation on highland sites in Thailand. The tree is recommended as a shade tree for coffee plantations. It is planted at a spacing of 3 x 3 metres and, after 5 - 7 years when the pines have reached a height of at least 4 metres, young coffee is planted. The needles contain a substance called terpene, this is released when rain washes over the needles and it has a negative effect on the germination of some plants, including wheat.","Oleoresin of good quality is tapped from the trees. The oleoresin is distilled to give turpentine and rosin. Turpentine is used in the paint industry, and rosin in the production of paper, soap and glue.  Old and slow growing trees often develop a red heartwood. This can be chipped and used as torches.  The heartwood is red-yellow to red-brown, darkening upon exposure; it is usually clearly demarcated from the 35 - 50mm wide band of pale yellow sapwood. The wood contains numerous resin canals, often visible as straight brown scratches on longitudinal surfaces. The texture is medium to fairly coarse and uneven; the grain straight; growth rings are distinct. The wood is light to moderately heavy; soft; not very durble. It seasons quickly with very little risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. It saws easily and can be worked to a smooth surface with all tools, but the high resin content may cause dulling of tool edges; nailing and screwing properties are good; gluing is correct; the wood takes paints and varnishes well. It is easy to cut into smooth, tight veneer. The wood is used as a general purpose, softwood timber for construction, furniture, boxes, flooring, joinery, poles, mine props etc. It is also suitable for ship and boat building, agricultural implements, turnery, veneer, plywood and railway sleepers. The wood is used for the manufacture of particle board and pulp, but its usefulness depends on the quality of the wood. The wood is used as fuel wood, for the production of charcoal and for torches.","Seed - some highland provenances have a slight temperature dormancy, and it is recommended to cool down imbibed seed for 2 - 3 weeks in a refrigerator before sowing. Pre-soaking the seed in warm water at 40 - 50°c, then cooling it down for a night enhances germination. Sowing in sand in a seedbed and transplanting into polythene tubes is most common. Germination is quite fast for pre-treated seed - usually 5 - 20 days. Time in the nursery is 6 months to 1 year, planting out when the plants are 14 - 20 cm tall. Seedlings may already be suitable for transplanting after 4 - 6 months. Successful natural regeneration is only possible where a relatively large amount of sunlight reaches the ground.  The seeds can be stored for several years, provided they are kept dry, cold and in an airtight container. Air-layering. Top cleft grafting. Mass propagation by rooting cuttings from hedged orchards is technically possible but not yet operational on a large scale325"

46,Shorea robusta,NA,Sal,"Sal is an evergreen tree with an elongated crown when young, becoming more rounded as the tree ages. It can grow up to 50 metres tall in fertile soils, but is more likely to be 20 - 25 metres tall in poorer soils. The straight, cylindrical bole can be unbranched for up to 25 metres and up to 200cm in diameter. Sal is a very important multi-purpose tree. It is one of the main commercial timbers of India, being harvested from the wild for local use and export. It also yields a resin that is traded and an oil that is used locally as well as being exported in large quantities. It addition, it supplies tannins, an edible seed and medicines for local use. The leaves are used commercially for making plates and containers. The sal tree is often the dominant species in the forests of the sub-Himalayan tract, but overutilization of it for fuel, timber, fodder etc is becoming a cause for conservation concern in some areas.

It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 3,500mm, but tolerates 1,000 - 7.300mm. There is usually a dry season of 4 - 8 months. Prefers a position in full sun, but tolerates light shade. Succeeds in most well-drained, fertile soils, though it prefers a moist sandy loam with good subsoil drainage. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6.7, tolerating 4.5 - 7.5. Young trees grow quickly, developing a long taproot at a very young age and attaining top heights of up to 6 metres after 6 years. Fruit and seed bearing begins around the age of 15 years, the tree then bears fruit regularly every 2 years or so, and a good seed-bearing year can be expected every 3 - 5 years. The tree responds well to coppicing. Rotations of 30 - 40 years are used when coppice regeneration is practised, and 80 - 160 years for high forest regeneration. The tree is very tolerant of forest fires, usually surviving them if not too small.","Seed - roasted. The seeds are boiled into a porridge with the flowers of Bassia latifolia and the fruits of Dolichos biflorus. They can be ground into a coarse flour that is used to make bread, and the plant is used as a famine food. A de-fatted kernel powder, popularly known as sal seed cake, contains about 50% starch, in addition to proteins, tannins and minerals. The physico-chemical property of the starch can be exploited for preparing canned food products. The chemical composition of the seeds consists of 10.8% water, 8% protein, 62.7% carbohydrate, 14.8% oil, 1.4% fibre and 2.3% ash.

It is used to caulk boats and ships and as incense. In some places in the Upper Tista forests of the Darjeeling District, large pieces, often 450 - 600 cubic centimetres in size, are found in the ground at the foot of the trees.  The leaves are widely used for making plates, cups and for wrapping.  An oil obtained from the seed is used for illumination.  The bark is a source of tannins.  The heartwood is a dark, reddish brown; the thin band of sapwood whitish. The grain is strongly spiralled and rather coarsely structured. The wood is hard, heavy, very durable and highly resistant to termite attack. Seasoning can present problems. The wood is easy to saw, but because of its high resin content, it is difficult to plane and turn; it has a tendency to split when nails are driven into it. This important Indian hardwood is especially well suited for constructing structures subject to heavy stress in houses etc, it is also used in hydraulic engineering, ships and railway cars, poles, railway ties and posts, simple interior finishing such as window frames and floors, and many other applications. For making household or agricultural implements, the coppice shoots are used. The wood is an important local source of fuel.","We have no specific information for this species - the information below is a general guide for the genus.  Seed - best sown as soon as possible. It does not require pre-treatment, but it is recommended to soak the seed for 12 hours prior to sowing. The seeds are sown in seedbeds, where they are covered with a mixture of sand and soil (1:1) or with a thin layer of sawdust. Germination of fresh seeds is usually good and rapid. About two weeks after germination, when the seedlings are 5 - 6cm tall, they are potted up into individual containers about 15 x 23cm with good drainage holes at their base. It is normally recommended to use a mixture of forest soil and sand (at a ratio of 3:1) as the potting medium in order to introduce the appropriate mycorrhiza to the roots. The seedlings are placed in 50 - 60% sunlight and watered twice daily. Seedlings can be planted out when 30 - 40cm tall - harden the seedlings off in full sunlight for one month prior to planting."

It succeeds in dry areas, but fruits best in more humid regions. At its climatic limits, as in California, the tree grows vigorously but will not bear fruit. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 18 - 38°c, but can tolerate 5 - 40°c. The mature plant can tolerate occasional temperatures down to about -3°c. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,200 - 1,600mm, but tolerates 700 - 4,000mm. It dislikes dry seasons unless growing in soils with adequate moisture levels. Succeeds in any reasonable soil in full sun or part day shade. Young plants require some shade and a moist environment. Tolerates poor, sandy and alkaline soils, but grows slowly and reproduces poorly. Often found in poorly drained soils. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, tolerating 5 - 8. The tree is said to tolerate wind and salt. The trees have naturalized themselves thoroughly in the wetter parts of Guatemala. Natural regenerarion from seed on suitable sites is generally abundant and will proceed under almost any condition. Young plants have a slow rate of growth, speeding up as they grow older. Two year old plants are around 80cm tall, up to 3 metres by the age of 7 and to 4.5 metres at the age of 10 years. Trees coppice very vigorously. A plant can produce dense stands of sprouts up to 3.6 metres tall just 12 months after being cut back to ground level. Fruiting can be expected within 4 years, especially from layered plants. In some areas it blooms and fruits sporadically nearly all the year round, whilst in other areas it has a clear fruiting season. Trees in the open usually fruit abundantly, but fruiting reduces as the shade increases. In India, a mature rose apple tree is said to yield 2 kg of fruit each season. The fruits are, of course, very light in weight because they are hollow, but this is a very small return for a tree that occupies so much space. Trees coppice very vigorously.","Fruit - usually eaten raw, the fruit can also be stewed, made into jams, jellies, confections etc. A sweet flavour with a crisp and crunchy texture, the fruit is somewhat to very juicy and has a delicate, rose-water fragrance. When cooked with custards or puddings, they impart a rose-like flavour. The large, hollow seed cavity is sometimes utilized to stuff the fruits and bake them .The fruit has to be handled very carefully after harvesting because it bruises easily and then loses its crispness. The fruit is up to 4cm x 6cm. Around the tropical world, the fruit is mostly eaten out-of-hand by children. It is seldom marketed. In the home, it is sometimes stewed with some sugar and served as dessert. The fruit can be distilled to yield a rosewater that is said to be equal to the best obtained from rose petals.  Flowers - candied.","Medicinal : Several parts of the tree are used medicinally as a tonic or a diuretic.  In India, the fruit is regarded as a tonic for the brain and liver. An infusion of the fruit acts as a diuretic.  A sweetened preparation of the flowers is believed to reduce fever..  The seeds are employed against diarrhoea, dysentery and catarrh. In Nicaragua, it has been claimed that an infusion of roasted, powdered seeds is beneficial to diabetics. They say in Colombia that the seeds have an anaesthetic property.  The leaf decoction is applied to sore eyes, also serves as a diuretic and expectorant and treatment for rheumatism. The juice of macerated leaves is taken as a febrifuge. Powdered leaves have been rubbed on the bodies of smallpox patients for the cooling effect.  The bark contains 7-12.4% tannin. It is astringent, emetic and cathartic. The decoction is administered to relieve asthma, bronchitis and hoarseness.  Cuban people believe that the root is an effective remedy for epilepsy. Agroforestry Uses: If the young plants are pruned severely, they become very dense and form an effective if not particularly handsome wind-break hedge. Plants develop massive root systems and can be useful for stabilizing soils on river banks. However, the dense top growth can stop any plant growth underneath, and this has sometimes led to sheet erosion unless the crown is thinned. Bees produce a heavy, consistent flow of amber honey from the flowers790","A yellow coloured essential oil, important in the perfume industry, is derived from the leaves by distillation. It contains, among other properties, 26.84% dl-a-pinene and 23.84% l-limonene, and can be resorted to as a source of these elements for use in the perfume industry.  The bark contains 7% tannin on a dry weight basis and is used by local villagers for tanning and dyeing purposes. The bark also yields a brown dye.  The flexible branches split easily. They are valued for making wattle, hoops for large sugar casks, and also are valued for weaving large baskets.  The heartwood is dark-red or brown; the sapwood is white. The wood is straight and close-grained, medium-heavy to heavy, strong. It is not durable in the ground and is prone to attack by dry wood termites. It is usually too small for many purposes, but is commonly used for fenceposts, plant stakes etc, and larger pieces can be used to make furniture, spokes for wheels, arms for easy chairs, knees for all kinds of boats, beams for construction, frames for musical instruments (violins, guitars, etc.), and packing cases. It is also popular for general turnery. The wood makes an excellent fuel and charcoal","Seed - the seeds have a very short viability and no dormancy; they usually germinate well within 10 - 120 days if sown fresh. Surface sow the seed in a shady position, firming it gently into the soil, and water well but be careful not to wash the seed away. A single seed often gives rise to 3 - 8 seedlings and most of them are true to type. Young plants transplant badly, so should be potted up into individual containers as soon as they are large enough to handle and before the roots have grown much. Young plants need some shade.

Teak is one of the most important timbers in the world - a rare combination of superior physical and mechanical properties makes it a paragon of timber, and there is no likelihood of it being eclipsed by any other. It is widely planted for timber in the tropics. Teak is often grown in botanical gardens and is occasionally cultivated in tropical countries as an ornamental for its large leaves and spreading flower clusters303",The fine dust produced in machining operations may cause irritation of the skin or bronchial asthma and rhinitis after inhalation; a well-functioning dust extractor fan is recommended. The substance responsible for the allergic reaction is probably the naphthoquinone desoxylapachol,"E. Asia - Indian subcontinent, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam",Occurs naturally in various types of tropical deciduous forests,"Habit Deciduous Tree Height 30.00 m Growth Rate Fast Pollinators Bees, Flies, Ants Self-fertile No Cultivation Status Cultivated, Ornamental, Wild","A plant of the tropics, where it is found at elevations from sea level to 1,200 metres. It is able to survive and grow under a wide range of climatic and edaphic conditions, but grows best in a warm, moist, tropical climate with a significant difference between dry and wet seasons. It is found in areas where the mean annual temperature is in the range 14 - 36°c. The tree can be killed by temperatures falling down to 3°c. It prefers a mean annual rainfall: of 1,200 - 2,500mm, but is able to succeed with as little as 600mm, or as much as 4,000mm. Requires a sunny position. The most suitable soil is deep, well-drained, fertile alluvial-colluvial soil with a pH of 6.5 - 8 and a relatively high calcium and phosphorous content. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 7.5, tolerating 4.5 - 8.5. The quality of growth, however, depends on the depth, drainage, moisture status and the fertility of the soil. Teak does not tolerate waterlogging or infertile lateritic soils. Initial growth of the tree is rapid. At an age of 5 years, an average height of 13 metres with a bole diameter of 10cm is not unusual; after 10 years, 16.5 metres and 15 cm; after 20 years, 21.5 metres and 23.5 cm. After 15 or 20 years, growth slows down. In stands of 80-year-old trees, maximum height is about 45 metres, with a maximum diameter of 75 cm. The rotation period is approximately 80 years. The height of the tree at the moment of first flowering is important in silviculture. When it is long (it may reach up to 10 metres), the final bole form is positively affected, but early-flowering trees may develop extremely wide crowns and short boles. This characteristic is clearly undesirable in timber-crop species and warrants strong selection against flowering in conjunction with increased effort to develop commercial methods of vegetative propagation. The time of the 1st inflorescence is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. In Thailand, flowering normally starts at the age of 8 to 10 years. However, trees have been observed to flower at the age of 3 months, while a few specimens of superior phenotype did not flower until the age of 27 years. Flowers usually appear during the rainy season, and trees tend to flower synchronously. For plantations, stumps are planted at a spacing of 2 x 2 metres. As the tree is deciduous, raising pure plantations is discouraged; rather, it is recommended to raise 80% of mixed indigenous species and the remaining 20% teak. The average plantation yield in Java is 60 - 100 cubic metres/ha, including thinning. Occasionally the final harvest may yield as much as 390 cubic metres/ha in stands 80 years old. The mean annual volume increment is (min. 1) 3-6 (max. 15) cubic metres/ha. The root system is superficial, often no deeper than 50 cm, but the roots may extend laterally up to 15 metres from the stem. Young plants show a remarkable capability to recover after fire.","The leaves are added to the water in which unripe jackfruit is boiled prior to making the Javanese dish 'Gudeg'. This adds a fresh, reddish colour to the jackfruit.  A red dye obtained from boiling the wood shavings of the tree has been used to colour Easter Eggs.  The leaves act as a host for Rhizopus spores in Tempeh manufacture.","A wood tar paste is made from the powdered wood by putting it into hot water. It is vermifuge; promotes digestion; is effective in relieving bilious headaches and tooth aches; reduces inflammations or eruptions of the skin. The charred wood, soaked in poppy juice and made into a paste, has been used to relieve the swelling of the eyelids. The wood has been used as a hair tonic. An oil extracted from the roots is used to treat eczema, ringworms and inflammation.  The bark has been used as an astringent and in the treatment of bronchitis.  The flowers are diuretic. They are used to treat biliousness, bronchitis and urinary disorders.  The seeds are diuretic. An oil extracted from the seeds promotes hair growth.  The leaves have a reputation of being diuretic, depurative, purgative, stimulant, antidysenteric and vermifuge. They are used in traditional medicine to treat anaemia, asthenia, fever and malaria, amoebiasis, schistosomiasis and tuberculosis. Extracts of the leaves are reported to be effective against mycobacterium tuberculosis, to treat bleeding of larynx, trachea, bronchi, or lungs, and sore throat. An oil extracted from the tender shoots is used against scabies in children. Agroforestry Uses: Teak is a pioneer species, but with a long life span. In contrast to other pioneer species, it is able to persist and dominate and to naturally regenerate towards the climax phase of succession in most parts of its natural range. Soya bean mixed with teak not only makes the latter grow better but also allows harvesting of the bean for food; the soya stems, roots and leaves are added to the soil as fertilizer.","Both the root bark and the young leaves produce a yellowish-brown or reddish dye, which is used for paper, clothes and matting. It requires a mordant. The dye from the leaves prevents the blackening of yama after thay are cooked.  The leaves are used for packing food products in the markets.  An oil extracted from the seeds promotes hair growth.  Sawdust from teakwood is used as incense in Java; the dust, however, may irritate the skin. The sawdust is also used to produce active carbon.  The heartwood is often dull yellowish when freshly cut but turns golden brown or sometimes dark greyish-brown after exposure, often streaked grey or black; it is distinctly demarcated from the up to 50mm thick band of yellowish-white or pale yellowish-brown sapwood. The grain is straight, wavy or slightly interlocked, with a rather coarse and uneven texture, growth rings are distinct. The wood is oily to the touch and when freshly cut has a smell reminiscent of leather. The wood is a medium weight timber that is rather soft, it is durable to very durable, with an average service life in contact with the ground of more than 10 years under tropical conditions and more than 25 years under temperate conditions. It dries well but rather slowly, rates of shrinkage are low, once dry it is very stable in service. It is not difficult to work, but requires some effort, mainly because of the presence of silica (up to 1.5%); stellite-tipped saws and tools tipped with tungsten carbide are indispensable for sawing and planing operations; it is difficult to chisel with a hollow square mortiser, but turns well; nail and screw-holding capacities are good, but pre-boring is recommended to avoid splitting; gluing is only successful on freshly machined or newly sanded surfaces. The wood bending properties are moderate; there is a tendency to buckle, and the wood is only suitable for bends of moderate curvature; painting, staining and polishing require freshly machined surfaces or a pretreatment with thinner, however it can be varnished and polished beautifully. Being classified as very resistant to teredo activity, the wood is an excellent timber for bridge building and other construction in contact with water such as docks, quays, piers and floodgates in fresh water. In house building, teakwood is particularly suitable for interior and exterior joinery (windows, solid panel doors and framing) and is used for floors exposed to light to moderate pedestrian traffic. It is also used quite extensively for garden furniture. Other uses are for building poles, transmission line poles, fence posts, wallboards, beams, woodwork, boxes, musical instruments, toys, railway sleepers and railcar construction. It is brittle and therefore less suitable for articles requiring high resilience, such as tool handles and sporting goods. Its high resistance to a wide variety of chemicals makes it ideal for laboratory and kitchen tables as well as for scrubbing towers, vats, pipes and fume ducts in industrial chemical plants. The wood grains are figured well, producing an attractive veneer, which is extensively used in the manufacture of furniture and interior fittings. Teakwood is suitable for the manufacture of decorative plywood. Larger logs are utilized for beams and sleepers, smaller ones for scantlings and battens, and thinner top ends and poles are used as round posts. Thinnings are also used for timber. For the export market, teakwood is recommended for ship decking and other constructional work in boat building. Teakwood has been used in the manufacture of charcoal and as fuel wood, but nowadays it is usually considered too valuable for anything but pruning remnants and other rejects to be used in this way.","Seed - fresh seed is more difficult to germinate than seed that has been stored for 12 months. If it is necessary to use fruits from the same year they were collected, then they should be subjected to alternate wetting then drying for 24 hours each for 14 days. Stored seed germinates best if soaked for 24 - 48 hours in warm water, prior to sowing, changing the water frequently. Another method of encouraging germination is to char (or half burn) the fruits by covering them with a thin layer of grass and lighting it. The germination rate is low, usually less than 50%, but sometimes up to 80%. Germination usually starts after 10 days but may take 2 - 3 months. Seedlings should be given a little shade for their first year and can then be planted into their permanent positions. Natural regeneration is particularly abundant in forests exposed to fires and often occurs in patches. Seeds collected from the forest floor are generally used to establish plantations. It is recommended that seeds be collected from trees over 20 years old. Seed is often collected from selected stands. Fruit that has lain dormant in the ground for 30 - 40 years has been known to germinate abundantly.  Both grafting and budding methods showed better results than branch cutting methods. The rooting time of cutting is 8 - 15 days, and the survival rate of rooted stock is 90 - 100%."

The buttressed bole usually has a diameter of up to 200cm, though exceptionally to 300cm, and can be branchless for up to 20 metres. The tree has long been used in Indian herbal medicine, the fruits being gathered from the wild and from cultivation. The tree is cultivated everywhere in India because of its fruits and the tannin-rich bark.",The seeds are possible toxic or narcotic,"E.

It is found at elevations up to 1,400 metres in China. In its natural area of distribution mean annual precipitation varies from 1,000 to over 3,000 mm. It grows best in areas where annual daytime annual temperatures are within the range 20 - 33°c, though it can tolerate 5 - 45°c. It is fairly sensitive to frost, though seedlings can survive, particularly when covered with grass. Generally, temperatures of -1°c can kill a tree. Succeeds in any moderately fertile, well-drained soil in a sunny position. Young trees are somewhat shade tolerant. Prefers periodically dry soils, and is moderately drought tolerant. Plants can tolerate short periods of inundation. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, but tolerates 5 - 7.5. Trees are leafless for a short period (some weeks) in the dry season. Pollination may be done by insects, as the flowers have unpleasant odour, which attracts flies. Trees planted at a spacing of 1 metre x 6 metres in Java have a mean annual increment in height of 1.6 metres and diameter of 2.1 cm at the age of 15 years; when sown directly at 1 metre x 3 metres the trees closed their canopy after 5 years and gave an annual height and diameter increment of 1.2 metres and 1.3 cm, respectively, after 6 years. The trees had reached a height of 20 - 25 metres in 15 years, after a few thinnings. Trees react well to coppicing, but pollarding does not give good results.","The seeds are edible. They are possibly toxic or narcotic. Eating the seeds in any but small quantities can lead to narcotic effects.  The dark red fruits are edible. They can be used for making preserves. Subacid, with a pleasant flavour, the smooth-skinned fruit is about 3cm in diameter.","The fruit contains anthraquinones and tannins. It is anthelmintic, astringent (especially when ripe), digestive, tonic and laxative (especially when unripe). The fruit is used internally principally in the treatment of digestive and respiratory problems. In Indian herbal medicine the ripe fruit is used in cases of diarrhoea and indigestion, whilst the unripe fruit is used as a laxative in cases of chronic constipation. The fruit is often used to treat upper respiratory tract infections that cause symptoms of sore throats, hoarseness and coughs. Externally, the fruit is used to make a lotion for sore eyes.  The sour fruits are one of the ingredients of 'triphala', an Ayurvedic rejuvenative, laxative tonic based on this species plus the fruits of Phyllanthus emblica and Terminalia chebula.","The bark is used for making a dye. The dried fruits contain 20 - 25% tannin. The fruits yield a dye that is occasionally used together with iron sulphate for dyeing black cloth and matting, as a cheap substitute for indigo, and for preparation of ink.  The leaves are a source of tannins.  The seeds yield about 40% of a clear yellow oil, composed of 12% palmitic acid, 16% stearic acid, 43% oleic acid and 29% linoleic acid. It is used for hair-oil and in the manufacture of soap. An excellent soap can be prepared using a mixture of 60% of this oil, 25% coconut oil and 15% groundnut oil.  An insoluble gum is produced in considerable quantity from the trunk.  The timber is yellowish-grey, lacking heartwood, light to moderately heavy, fairly straight-grained, very coarse-textured. It is not durable, and very prone to insect attack, though durability is said to be improved by immersing the wood in water. It is considered to be of little value. It is used for construction and agricultural implements, especially in regions where other timber is scarce or expensive. Large-sized stems are used for dug-out canoes. The wood is valued for fuel and for making charcoal.","Seed - pre-soaking in cold water for 24 hours prior to sowing has been reported to improve germination rates. Buried seeds have a better chance of successful germination. The germination rate is quite high for fresh seeds, with reports of 85 - 100% germination, but it declines rapidly when seeds have been stored for some time. Germination needs much moisture, and usually takes 2 - 5 weeks. Usually sown in a nursery seedbed, the seed can also be sown directly in the field when conditions are favourable. When seedlings are raised in the nursery, transplanting to the field before the taproot has developed is strongly preferable, and mostly successful. Clipping the roots and shoots checks growth considerably, stumping is not advised."

The bark is a powerful astringent, febrifuge, tonic, and antiperiodic. It is used to treat chronic dysentery and wounds. A resinous gum obtained from the bark is used to treat boils.  The flowers are emmenagogue. Agroforestry Uses: Mountain cedar has been used in reforestation projects and is also planted to provide firebreaks.","The flowers contain a red colouring matter and also a sulphur-coloured dye. Cotton and woollen fabric can be dyed a dull yellow by mere immersion in a boiling extract of the flowers. Used in conjunction with safflower and turmeric, they produce a sulphur-yellow colour.  The bark contains tannin.  A fibre obtained from the bark has been used traditionally for twines and the manufacture of string bags.  An aromatic oil can be extracted from the fruit.  Some extracts from the bark have insect-repellent properties. Extracts from the bark, heartwood and leaves apparently have insecticidal qualities.  The wood is used for shiitake mushroom culture.  The heartwood is pale brown, cedar brown, dark red-brown or brick red when first cut, darkening upon exposure to a rich reddish-brown with darker brown streaks. The sapwood is pinkish-white, red or pale yellow-brown, it smells strongly of cedar when cut. The grain is generally straight to somewhat interlocked, the texture moderately close and uneven, and the wood lustrous. A strong, fragrant, long-lasting spicy odour is usually present. The wood is moderately hard, lightweight, tough and durable. Staining is satisfactory, and the timber takes both water- and oil-based paints well. The wood has a variety of uses such as for carvings, boat building, cabinet making, cigar boxes, matchboxes, decorative plywood and veneer, food containers, high-grade furniture, interior trim, joinery, musical instruments, ornamental work, panelling, boxes and crates, building materials, exterior uses, millwork, mouldings. The timber of this species has always been highly regarded in the manufacture of light-weight racing boats particularly sailing boats and dinghies",Seed - germinates quicker and better under shade. It should be broadcast thinly on raised and shaded nursery beds soon after collection. Germination takes 8 - 15 days and fresh seed has a germination rate of 50 - 80%.
